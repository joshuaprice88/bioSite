                    <p class = "early">
                            Dani is a Graphic Designer by day, bad jokes machine by night, Dani is a whirlwind of enthusiasm, energy, and an accidentally-sometimes-very-loud voice. Her interests range from art to football, Pokemon to high-end makeup, board games to beer Olympics. A fierce competitor, she strives for excellence in everything she attempts. She enjoys writing, cooking, Texas Hold 'Em, and teaching herself new skills. She also loves going on adventures with her Husband, taking massive amounts of pictures of her cats, and ordering tater-tot pizza and binge watching whatever her and her husband have decided is their “New Show”. Dani is an Omaha native, she has lived here most of her life (other than a short time in Phoenix we won’t talk about).
